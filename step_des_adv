forks:

A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forks let you make changes to a project without
affecting the original repository. You can fetch updates from or submit changes to 
the original repository with pull requests.

Sync a fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository.

If you don't have push (write) access to an upstream repository, then you can pull
commits from that repository into your own fork.

For greater collaboration, you can allow commits on branches you've created from forks.
Permission to commit to your forked branches is limited to those with push access to the 
upstream repository of the fork.
